            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>Quick Start:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.</li>
                <li>Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.</li>
                <li>To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Detailed Instructions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.</li>
                <li>If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.</li>
                <li>To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.</li>
                <li>If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.</li>
                <li>Click the "New Game" button to start a new game.</li>
            </ul>
